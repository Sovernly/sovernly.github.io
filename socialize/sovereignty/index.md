# Digital Sovereignty & Local Control

Digital sovereignty means local ownership and control of digital infrastructure and data by citizens.

- **Community-Led Governance:** Citizens manage their own digital systems through transparent, participatory decision-making.
- **Local Decision-Making:** Local councils or assemblies ensure policies reflect community values and needs.
- **Independence:** No involvement from corporations or AI preserves the systemâ€™s integrity and sovereignty.
