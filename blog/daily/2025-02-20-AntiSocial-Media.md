# Anti-Social Media must be destroyed

Our current technological platforms that connect us as humans, as workers, and as citizens have been so completely subverted against our collective interests that we now find ourselves at the precipice of destruction.

While one could argue that we deserve what is being done to us by allowing it in the first place, that is a fatalist viewpoint that is of no good to anyone but those that seek to subjugate us. We were led down this primrose path by the very ones who now control the narratives so utterly completely. They sell you "freedom" while subjugating you. Never being honest that true freedom is not "Being able to do whatever I want to whomever I want" but rather never having to do anything that I DON'T want to do. They sell you a nostalgic image of a libertarian paradise that has never existed. One that they have many times attempted to bring to fruition has ALWAYS devolved into totalitarianism. They see this as a feature, not a bug.

## Fatal Design Flaw

There is a single, fatal design flaw in the architecture of these systems. One that is exploited by those with capital to define the conversation in a way that is either favorable to them, or at least in a way that stops the conversation when it is unfavorable to them. Combined here in the United States with the unholy alliance of politicians and capital accelerated by the CItizens United Decision.
