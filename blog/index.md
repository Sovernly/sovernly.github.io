We strive to create a system that is owned and controlled by the locality of concern, operating within a framework to maximize citizen participation and control before it is too late. We don't need to ask. We don't need permission. This can be done by the people, for the people.

## Design Goals

Our [Design Goals](designgoals.md) are intended to ensure that the overall architecture accomplishes something useful for the end user, without inflicting negative outcomes for other users within the overall system.
